# In-class coding exercise #6
Objective: In this exercise you will practice loading data from netCDF files using xarray, indexing and selecting data in DataSets, and mapping 2-D data using Cartopy.

## <font color='red'><i>**Important:** Double check that your code fully runs before submitting to Gradescope! When you are done: refresh the kernel, run each of the cells one by one, and check for errors.</i></font>


## Instructions:

1. Assign group roles and note them in the text box below.

2. The group **developer** will get code from the GitHub repository, then open in in JupyterHub. Make sure you are using the same teams as last week!

3. Edit this README to include your group members at the top of the page. 

4. Complete the assignment together by writing and executing text and code cells as specified. For this assignment, **do not use any features of Python that have not yet been discussed in the lessons or class sessions.**

5. Use the check cells after your solution cells to run the autograder and check your answers. If you fail a test, do not panic! Carefully read the error output, and use that information to go back and fix your code. 

6. Discuss the reflection questions at the end of the exercise. The group reporter will type concise answers to each in the provided text box.

7. If, _and only if_, you have time after finishing your questions, work on the extra credit at the end (1 point). **We expect you to work on the extra credit if you have extra time, _and we will check that you have completed it if we see your group leaving very early_. However, make sure to give yourself at least 10 minutes before the end of class to push to GitHub and submit on Gradescope.** 

8. When you're finished and are ready to submit the exercise, the group developer will push the completed notebook to GitHub then submit it to Gradescope. No submission is necessary from other group members, but make sure to add all your group members to the Gradescope submission.

**If you get an unprotected private file key error, make sure to run your "chmod" command on your ssh private key file!** <br>
```chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519```

## Reminder: Group Exercise Instructions
You will work together with the same group each Thursday this quarter, submitting a single code at the end of the class period. Decide among yourselves which roles you would like to undertake. Note that you cannot have the same role two weeks in a row, and you must fill each role at least once during the quarter. <br>

Furthermore, you will be graded on both correctness in your solution outputs and your coding strategy. Even if you pass the autograder test by getting the correct answer, you will not receive full credit if you hardcode your answer or use other Python functions/packages not discussed yet in the course. We will also be grading on using best coding practices. This means **printing your variables, including comments in your answers, and no hardcoding.**

### Roles and Responsibilities:


1. Developer: Person who types the code and submits it to Gradescope at the end of the class period.

2. Reporter: Responsible for communicating with instructors, writing exercise reflection, and keeping any written notes.

3. Researcher: Search slides, notes, and internet for solutions to coding problems.

4. Documenter: Make sure code is adequately commented. Make sure any code solutions used from an online source like Stack Overflow are clearly noted and cited to avoid plagiarism.
